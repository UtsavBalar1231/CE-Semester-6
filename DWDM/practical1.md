- Rapid Miner
- Orange
- IBM SPSS
- Knime
- Rattle
- Weka
- DataMelt

### Rapid miner
- A data science software platform providing an integrated environment for various stages of data modelling
including data preparation, data cleansing, exploratory data analysis, visualization and more.
- The techniques that the software helps with are machine learning, deep learning, text mining and predictive analytics.
- Easy to use GUI tools that take you through the modelling process.
- This tool written entirely in Java is an open-source framework and is wildly popular in the data mining world.
- This open-source is written in Java and can be integrated with WEKA and R-tool

### Orange
- Orange is a python-based open-source data mining software. 
- It is a great tool for those starting in data mining but also for experts.
- Orange also supports machine learning algorithms for data modelling, regression, clustering, preprocessing, and so on. 

### H3O
- H3O is an open-source data mining software used mainly by organizations to analyze data stored in cloud infrastructure.
- This tool is written in R language but is also compatible with Python for building models.
- One of the greatest advantages is that H3O allows a fast and easy deployment into production due to Java's language support.

### IDM SPSS
- SPSS stands for Statistical Product and Service Solutions.
- The software's advanced abilities provide a broad library of machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis (descriptive, regression, clustering, etc.), text analysis, integration with big data, and so on.
- Moreover, SPPS allows the user to improve their SPSS Syntax with Python and R by using specialized extensions.

### Knime
- KNIME, the Konstanz Information Miner, is a free and open-source data analytics, reporting and integration platform.
- KNIME integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining "Building Blocks of Analytics" concept.
- A graphical user interface and use of JDBC(java database connectivity) allows assembly of nodes blending different data sources, including preprocessing (ETL: Extraction, Transformation, Loading), for modeling, data analysis and visualization without, or with only minimal, programming. 
- KNIME is implemented in Java, the software also provides nodes so that users can run it in Ruby, Python and R.

### Rattle
- The rattle is an R language based GUI tool for data mining requirements.
- The tool is free and open-source and can be used to get statistical and visual summaries of data, the transformation of data for data models,
build supervised and unsupervised machine learning models and compare model performance graphically.

### WEKA
- Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis  (Weka) is a suite of machine learning tools written in Java and its open source.
- A collection of visualization tools for predictive modelling in a GUI presentation,
helping you build your data models and test them, observing the model performances graphically.

### DataMelt
- DataMelt is a computation and visualization environment which offers an interactive structure for data analysis and visualization.
- It is primarily designed for students, engineers, and scientists. It is also known as DMelt.
- DMelt is a multi-platform utility written in JAVA. It can run on any operating system which is compatible with JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
